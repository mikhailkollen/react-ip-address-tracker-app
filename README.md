## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- React
- React-Leaflet
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

It was my first React project created from scratch. Although it was not obligatory to use React in this case, I decided to try it out. The challenge taught me how to use React-Leaflet, how to structure components and set up an application.

### Continued development

I am planning to apply my knowledge of React more and perhaps create a few more projects using React-Leaflet.

### Useful resources
